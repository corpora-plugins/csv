# The CSV Plugin for Corpora

This plugin makes the task "Import Content from CSV File" available for users to run. In order to use it, you must create a Corpus with a Content Type whose field names correspond to the columns named in the first line of your CSV file. This task has certain limitations, however, such as the fact that it cannot import multi-valued fields or perform cross-referencing to other Content Types, and is therefore best suited to importing simple, tabular data.
